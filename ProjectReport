This project is a simple and practical Daily Expense Tracker developed using Python. It provides an easy-to-use command-line interface where users can record their daily spending by entering the category, amount, and a brief description. Each entry is automatically saved with the current date in a CSV file, making the data organized and accessible. Users can view all recorded expenses and calculate their total spending whenever needed. The project emphasizes clarity, reliability, and straightforward functionality. It also serves as a foundational exercise in Python programming, helping users understand file handling, user input, and basic data processing while solving a real-life problem.
